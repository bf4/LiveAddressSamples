===============
These gems were developed by independent developers and we're happy to recommend them to you:

- https://github.com/peter-edge/smartystreets_ruby (supports street and ZIP code APIs, batch requests, and all documented fields)
- https://github.com/russ/smarty_streets (a basic wrapper for street address verification)
